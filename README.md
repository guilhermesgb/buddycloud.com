### Requirements

* Pelican 3.3
* ghp-import
* Markdown 2.3.1

### Introduction to Pelican

Pelican's [GETTING STARTED](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/getting_started.html/) page is a good place to learn about the basics of Pelican (installation, project skeleton, development cycle, etc.).

### Custom Domain configuration

This project builds a static website and deploys it into the GitHub Pages page associated with it, but there's nothing stopping you to using a Custom Domain for it.
Please refer to https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-cname-file-to-your-repository for more information on this process.
Then, beware that your CNAME file should be located under the `content` folder. You can simply rename the `/content/CNAME.example` file back to `/content/CNAME` and then edit its content to use a different custom domain.

### Custom Metadata options

Explanation about these new options added by me (guilhermesgb) coming soon.
